- name: "Novella"
  bio: "The teenage daughter of Front Page, Novella is an introvert, a lover of stories, and an aspiring author. Her cutie mark is an open book with a heart. She is often seen using magic to float a book (much easier than trying to hold it with hooves!). She can be moody and distant, but when it comes down to it, she really cares a lot for her family. Who knows, maybe someday she’ll write for the Everfree Press?"

- name: "Sharp Focus"
  bio: "Sharp Focus, or “Sharpie” for short, is the son of Front Page. A young pegasus colt who has yet to earn his cutie mark, Sharpie is too busy enjoying life to be overly concerned about his blank flank. He is a creative type, and very curious about the world. There are lots of possibilities available to this little colt. Maybe he’ll end up as a photographer, or perhaps a comic book artist. For now, Sharpie is happy to explore the world and make new discoveries!"

- name: "Marina"
  bio: "A new friend, Marina, is an orca sea pony residing in the waters of the Puget Sound. Marina loves collecting items that have been lost to the ocean by land ponies. She can often be seen breaching the waters near the ferries that travel around the Sound. Lots of ponies think they’re watching her, but she’s really trying to get a closer look at the passengers. Marina is very curious about the world outside the ocean."
