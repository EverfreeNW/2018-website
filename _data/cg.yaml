- name: "Igor"
  bio: "Igor, as a fan of the show since late 2011, has two long term goals in the fandom. The first is to create fashionable formal-wear accessories with which to allow ponies to be brought into nearly any working environment, and through this to ever so slowly elevate the fashion of the fandom at large. This may be a slow process, but it's certainly a worthwhile one. Now with the addition of two lasers, the inexhaustible pursuit of lasering ponies on all sorts of things is in full swing as well.<br/>
The second is, accepting the inevitable AI singularity and our eventual cybernetic overlords, to help make sure that there is pony present there as well. To this end, he has built a virtual reality simulation of Ponyville, with close to a hundred AI ponies, and a slowly expanding series of quests. A demo of this fledgling virtual world will be running at his vendor hall table via an Oculus Rift and the magic that is modern technology. Donning the headset it is possible for anyone to temporarily abandon their current existence and take on the form of a diminutive equine avatar."

Then the IDW Comic series was announced in July in 2012, and that completely changed. Absorbing any and all pieces of information about the comic series—in addition to buying everything related to that series in sight—The Illustrious Q quickly became one of the fandoms experts on the My Little Pony Comic world.

The son of an auto worker (have you driven a Ford lately?), high school and college athlete (baseball, football), former bodyguard and ranch hand, trained Big Time wrestler, and Harley mechanic whose custom motorcycles have appeared on the cover of “Easyriders”. A pessimist would say “he can’t make up his mind”; an optimist would say “no single career is big enough for his mustache”. And he watches a cartoon show intended for little girls. Well, what do you expect from the Manliest Brony in the World? What’s with that? Well, aside from making him grin like someone who just found a twenty dollar bill in his underwear, it’s given him a chance to do what he does best: ham it up. Dusty is known primarily for his former show “Stay Brony My Friends”, his YouTube videos which have gone viral, and separating convention-goers from their money at charity auctions. Dusty fearlessly treads upon the crushed skulls of YouTube trolls and hack journalists as he destroys stereotypes. What he is most proud of, though, is his fans. The finest bronies in the world (his audience… that includes YOU, right?) have come together to raise over 50,000 dollars for a variety of charities. This has also piqued the curiosity of documentary filmmakers. He can be seen in “Thatch and Dial”, a Youtube series he is collaborating on with Andy Stein (Mandopony), as well at the Analyst Anarchy TF2 series with Dr. Wolf and friends. His continued appearances on Bronies React, and new gig as multiple characters on the Fallout Equestria radio play by East Corp. Productions as well as in the animation “Allister and Melody” by Luximus. He co-starred in a student film called “Under” with an on screen roll. And completed his first book narrations in the “Portals of Infinity” series with book 3 “Of Temples and Trials” and book 4 “The Sea of Grass” on both Audible and Ibooks. Stay Brony, my Friends."
