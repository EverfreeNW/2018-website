Fans of My Little Pony are some of the most colorful and creative people around, and at Everfree Northwest they love to show it! Many of our attendees come in custom, hand-made costumes of their favorite characters. Each year we celebrate this by holding a photoshoot and cosplay contest. Get geared up and show your stuff!

Every year, Everfree Northwest holds a concert we like to call Ponystock! Featuring musicians from across the My Little Pony fandom, and covering all genres of music from acoustic, to rock, to electronic, Ponystock is an event worth staying up all night for!
