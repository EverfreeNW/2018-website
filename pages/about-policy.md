# Welcome to Everfree Northwest!

Our goal at Everfree Northwest is to bring Equestria to Earth in every way possible. Just as the land of Equestria has rules to help guide its citizens to a safe, friendly and harmonious way of life, Everfree Northwest has rules to help everypony enjoy the event. Please keep these rules in mind so that we can work together to create a pleasant experience that all can enjoy.

# General Rating

Much as the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, is designed with the enjoyment of young children and their parents in mind, so is the environment we wish to maintain for Everfree Northwest. We have adopted a general “PG” rating, which is to be considered at all times and in all areas of the convention. This simply means that attendees should refrain from strong language, displays of violence or blood, inappropriate dress, and depictions of illegal or age-inappropriate behaviors, real and/or fake. Please understand that children are invited to explore all areas of Everfree Northwest along with their parents/guardians, and the convention must be a safe place for them to do so without fear of experiencing something inappropriate.

# Harassment

Everfree Northwest does not tolerate harassment of any kind. This includes and is not limited to any behavior that intentionally annoys, threatens, or frightens others. If you are having a problem, ask an Everfree Northwest staff member for assistance. Let us keep the Golden Rule in mind and treat others as you would like to be treated. If you approach someone and they tell you to leave them alone, do so – your interaction with them is done. Refusal to respect the personal space of others is grounds for intervention by Everfree Northwest management and/or Venue staff and/or security, and the offending individual may be required to surrender their badge and leave the convention permanently without restitution. Also be advised that such action may expose the perpetrator to charges from the appropriate governmental authority.

# Abandoned Items

By attending Everfree Northwest, all attendees and other parties understand and agree that Everfree Northwest is not responsible for any personal property left in the convention space. After the conclusion of the event, any lost items found by Everfree Northwest will be turned over to the host venue’s lost and found. Lost items may be reclaimed at the front desk. If you think you left something behind, you may call (206) 246-8600.

# Alcohol

No matter your age, alcoholic beverages are strictly prohibited in convention spaces, and those that appear intoxicated will not be allowed in the convention space. Minors should be aware that illegal consumption or possession of alcohol by a minor may not only result in criminal penalties for the party providing the alcohol, but also may result in criminal penalties for the minor, including but not limited to incarceration and revocation of driving privileges by the state. Unlawful consumption or possession of alcohol by those under 21 will not be tolerated. This applies to our international attendees as well.

Serving or providing alcohol to minors in violation of the law is strictly prohibited. Everfree Northwest has a zero tolerance policy regarding any individual caught violating this rule. Any infraction will result in the immediate removal of the individual involved and their badge revoked, with no right of re-entry or restitution. It may also involve Everfree Northwest and/or hotel staff filing a report with the appropriate authorities.

# Smoking

Please follow hotel policies and all applicable laws regarding smoking in hotel rooms and all other spaces. There is a designated smoking area on-site at the hotel, and hotel staff will be happy to direct you to it. Washington State law prohibits smoking indoors and within twenty-five feet of doorways and building ventilation access. Those who fail to follow this policy may be subject to their badge being revoked, with no right of re-entry or restitution. All attendees are subject to the policies of the hotel, and hotel staff has the right to remove an attendee from the premises according to those policies.

# Illegal Substances/Behaviors

Please be advised that all substances illegal under state or federal law are prohibited from the convention space. Any illegal substances or paraphernalia will be reported to the appropriate authorities if discovered by Everfree Northwest staff. Everfree Northwest must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Use or possession of illegal substances, or engaging in other illegal behaviors, is grounds for revocation of badge and removal from the convention with no right of re-entry or restitution.

We would like to remind everyone that despite the laws in Washington State, smoking of cannabis/marijuana is not permitted on hotel premises by the hosting venue in accordance with the venue’s policies. It is therefore prohibited anywhere at the convention. The public use of cannabis, much like the public consumption of alcohol, can result in fines if caught by authorities. Persons found in possession, or under the influence, of such substances in the convention space will be asked to leave. Failure to follow instructions given by Everfree Northwest or hotel staff will result in the removal of badge and loss of access to the convention space and events.

# Badges

Badges must be visibly worn at all times during the convention. Those without a badge will not be granted access to the convention space and events. Please check with Convention Operations in the event a badge is lost. Please return any unattended badge to an Everfree Northwest staff member immediately. All badge replacements must be authorized by Registration. If a party is found in possession of a badge that does not belong to them, that party will be asked to surrender that badge. All parties are required to carry government issued photo identification at all times, per Washington state law.

# Clothing and Costumes

One of the great things about a convention is the opportunity for enthusiastic fans to dress up as some of their favorite characters! While many of us have interests that are outside My Little Pony, we remind everyone that Everfree Northwest is a family friendly event. We ask and encourage everyone to keep this in mind with selecting costumes appropriate to the theme of the convention which has a general “PG” rating and is considered an all-ages family-friendly event. Clothing that is overly revealing, poses a health or safety risk to the wearer or those around them, or does not promote a similar atmosphere as that of the rest of the convention is not allowed. Everfree Northwest reserves the right to deem any costume or attire unacceptable and may request the wearer to modify or remove the costume as necessary. We do welcome any and all costumes from other fan communities, so long as the costume adheres to Everfree Northwest’s policies.

# Weapons and Props

Another big part of costuming isn’t just the outfits themselves, but the accessories that go with them. For some of these outfits, the accessories in question might involve something that resembles a weapon. In an effort to keep things both fun and safe for those attending the convention, Everfree Northwest has strict guidelines we require everyone to follow in regards to what will and will not be allowed in the convention space.

Possession of any weapon in violation of applicable local/state/federal law is prohibited. Functional projectile weapons (i.e. firearms, bow/crossbow, paintball, etc...) are strictly prohibited in the convention space. This applies even if someone has a weapon permit or concealed weapon permit. Anyone found in possession of such weapons in the convention space is subject to discipline, up to and including badge revocation and immediate discharge from the event with no right of re-entry or restitution.

All prop weapons must be non-functional and peace-bonded. Peace-bonding involves marking the weapon with an extremely visible strap or band to make it clear that it is not intended to be used for violent purposes. There will be a peace-bonding station at the convention for this purpose. You are required to have an approved Everfree Northwest staff member peace-bond any prop weapons. Refusal may result in requirement to take the weapon back to your hotel room and/or off convention property. Everfree Northwest staff reserve the right to require peace-bonding or the removal of a weapon at their own discretion. Everfree Northwest will only accept peace-bonding markings placed by an Everfree Northwest staff member at the current event. Peace-bonding markings from previous years or other conventions will not be accepted.

Everfree Northwest has a blanket ban on props including but not limited to: live steel, even if sheathed, this is defined as swords, knives, or other objects made of metal that can take an edge; realistic firearms (i.e. guns); props featuring gore, such as bloody knives, swords, or chainsaws, even if they are not live steel; paddles of any sort; any other functioning non-gun projectile launchers (i.e. bows, “Nerf” launchers, etc.); and any prop that does not follow the convention’s PG rating.

Play acting and/or waving of props is considered brandishing and is a violation of Everfree Northwest Policy and may be a violation of local/state/federal ordinances. Failure to follow these policies may be grounds for revocation of badge(s) with no right of reentry or restitution.
Exotic weapons will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If you question whether or not a prop weapon needs a peace-bond, it most likely does.

Upon arrival at the convention, all persons will be required to immediately take their weapons to the peace-bonding station. At the peace-bonding station, an approved Everfree Northwest staff member will inspect the prop and ensure it is properly peace-bonded.

# Flyers

There will be a message board available at the Info Booth for people to post information, but it must be approved by info booth staff before posting. Please make sure flyers are family friendly and adhere to our “PG” rating. Do not post any flyers on the doors or walls of the hotel convention space – they will be removed if discovered by Everfree Northwest staff. Please note that individual hotel room doors are not convention space, and posting flyers on hotel room doors is covered by the hotel’s own policy.

# Hotel Policies

In keeping with being good guests to our hosts at the Doubletree Hotel Seattle Airport, all guests of the hotel must follow all hotel policies. This applies to daily convention attendees as well. When you are in the hotel, you must follow hotel policies as a hotel guest, even if you are staying elsewhere. This includes all noise policies. If hotel staff or Everfree Northwest staff asks you to close your hotel room door or lower your volume, you must do so. Those who fail to comply may be subject to revocation of their badge, with no right of re-entry or restitution.

# Pets

We all love our fuzzy, feathered, and scaly friends! Although our gracious host, the Doubletree Hotel Seattle Airport, is a pet friendly hotel, we would ask that everyone leave their pets at home, or in the care of someone you trust. Everfree Northwest may be overstimulating for some animals, and our goal is to keep all attendees and creatures safe. Working service animals are permitted in convention spaces, as required by law.

# Media Coverage and Press

We welcome all members of the press that wish to cover our event. Members of the press must check in with Registration, with the proper credentials, to obtain a Press Pass. This will grant them access to the convention space and events. Everfree Northwest reserves the right to grant or deny approval for all photography or video/audio recording requests, and permissions may be retracted at any time. Any and all VIP interview requests must be made and approved at least one month prior to the convention. Unconfirmed interview requests will not be entertained on site. For more information, please contact our Public Relations department at pr@everfreenw.com. Please be aware that by registering for the convention, all attendees are giving their permission to Everfree Northwest, and any parties associated with it, to use, in any manner, any images, sound, or video captured during events related to the convention.

# Minors

While we welcome our fans of all ages, we ask that any minor children under the age of 12 be accompanied at all times by a parent or designated guardian who has made contact information available to Everfree Northwest staff. All guardians must be age eighteen or over and must have purchased a badge to the convention. For children 12 and under, our Foal Badge is free of charge. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must purchase a Teen Badge. Please be advised that Everfree Northwest and its associated parties are not responsible for the supervision of minors at the convention, and by registering or attending the convention, all parties understand and agree to this limitation.

# Photography and Video Recording

We understand that there are those that love to capture the fun and excitement of a convention, not just for posterity, but also to share the experience with others. Everfree Northwest requires that everyone keep some common courtesy in mind. Cameras and other recording devices are allowed during most panels and events at the convention, but please refrain from flash photography. In the Vendor Hall, do not film or take pictures without direct permission of all parties involved. Please be respectful of anyone at the convention that states they do not wish have their picture taken or be filmed, including cosplayers, guests, vendors, musicians, and/or staff. Everfree Northwest staff reserve the right to prohibit photography, recording, and other forms of capture during certain events and in certain spaces. Please note that by entering the event, you grant Everfree Northwest unlimited rights to your badge name, likeness, and appearance for any and all purposes, including, but not limited to, advertising, recordkeeping, and live broadcasting.

# Public Decorum

Engaging in disruptive and unsafe behavior is strictly prohibited during the convention. These behaviors include, but are not limited to: physical and verbal harassment towards other individuals, any act which could result in the risk of harm to persons or property, sexual misconduct, engaging in activities prohibited by law, and the possession of any item defined as a weapon, unless it complies with the policy on weapons outlined in the “Weapons and Props” section. Those found violating these rules will be asked to refrain from such behavior, though some violations by their very nature will result in permanent expulsion from the convention. In such a case,  Everfree Northwest or Hotel staff may contact the authorities if appropriate. If further measures must be taken, Everfree Northwest reserves the right to ask anyone violating the rules to leave the convention, and may revoke the violator’s badge that would allow re-entry into the event. No refunds will be granted if Everfree Northwest chooses to revoke a badge for this reason or for any other violation of any policies, agreements, or codes of conduct applicable to Everfree Northwest. In addition, refunds will not be granted if a person is removed from the property by Hotel staff or law enforcement.

# Refunds

It is understood that registration for Everfree Northwest constitutes a non-refundable single-person admittance to the then current Everfree Northwest general convention event through issuing of an approved event badge that must be worn at all times while in convention space. Refunds for badges purchased will not be issued for any reason, though lost badges may be replaced given proper identification. Non-attendance for any reason will not entitle the purchaser to a refund. General admittance does not include access to any events designated as limited attendance, VIP, Sponsor, or “foal-only”. Events excluded from general admission will indicate additional rules or fees applicable to gain entrance along with any additional ticketing required for entry.

# Sleeping at the Convention

Please refrain from sleeping in the convention space. We ask that everyone return to a private space, such as a hotel room or residence, if they feel they need to sleep. If you do not already have a room, you can find booking information on the Everfree Northwest website. Public and convention areas are not authorized for overnight sleeping, and may result in removal from the property by Hotel staff.

# Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

The use of any unmanned aircraft systems, including, but not limited to, drones for recreational or business use, is expressly prohibited at Everfree Northwest. Everfree Northwest reserves the right to revoke badges for violations of this policy.

# Policy Revisions

The policies listed herein are subject to change at any time as deemed necessary by Everfree Northwest. Please note the policies published in the Convention Book may not be the latest, most up-to-date revision of such. The most current information will always be maintained on our website and at the Info Desk for general review.
