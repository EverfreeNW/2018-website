The final wave of community guests for Everfree Northwest 2018 is here!  50 days and counting until you’ll all have the opportunity to meet and interact with these talented community guests. We are pleased to welcome community guests from cosplayers and artists from all corners of the world and the fandom.  Read all about the last set of community guests below, and see what they have to offer in the thriving My Little Pony fandom. 

Lea Dabssi, known throughout the fandom as Imalou, is an amazingly talented young artist hailing from France and living in Ireland. Her current work involves character design on a CG feature about a very well known Hasbro franchise as part of the Boulder Media studio based in Dublin, Ireland.

Lea has been drawing seriously since age 11, beginning with her first tablet and Photoshop, and then becoming a freelance concept artist on various secret projects for the game industry and TV series once she started working professionally in 2016. Lea trained at New3Dge art school in Paris for 1 year and has been a part of the My Little Pony fandom since 2011, drawing ponies ever since.

She loves animals and animation - especially The Amazing World of Gumball and the anime, Card Captor Sakura. Her mother is a landscape artist, and her sister is an illustrator, so she comes from a very artsy family. Her favorite vacation spot is the beach near her place in Nantes where she indulges in a true French baguette or pain au chocolat while she dreams that the love of her life will appear with a crepe and okonomiyakis. Her favorite pony is Pinkie Pie, and with a such of love of french pastry, we can’t blame her.

Lea’s artistic inspirations are Gosia Arska, Ryan Lang, Aaron Blaise, Nathan Fowkes along with talent from the pony fandom such as Crookedtrees, Asassinmonkey, Celebi-Yoshi, Cannibalus and Yakovlev-val.


Dusty Katt - AKA The Manliest Brony in the World
Who is this goofball? And why can’t people stop staring at that mustache? Dusty’s life is a manly checklist. The son of an auto worker (have you driven a Ford lately?), high school and college athlete (baseball, football), former bodyguard and ranch hand, trained Big Time wrestler, and Harley mechanic whose custom motorcycles have appeared on the cover of “Easyriders”. A pessimist would say “he can’t make up his mind”; an optimist would say “no single career is big enough for his mustache”. And he watches a cartoon show intended for little girls. Well, what do you expect from the Manliest Brony in the World? What’s with that? Well, aside from making him grin like someone who just found a twenty dollar bill in his underwear, it’s given him a chance to do what he does best: ham it up. Dusty is known primarily for his former show “Stay Brony My Friends”, his YouTube videos which have gone viral, and separating convention-goers from their money at charity auctions. Dusty fearlessly treads upon the crushed skulls of YouTube trolls and hack journalists as he destroys stereotypes. What he is most proud of, though, is his fans. The finest bronies in the world (his audience… that includes YOU, right?) have come together to raise over 50,000 dollars for a variety of charities. This has also piqued the curiosity of documentary filmmakers. He can be seen in “Thatch and Dial”, a Youtube series he is collaborating on with Andy Stein (Mandopony), as well at the Analyst Anarchy TF2 series with Dr. Wolf and friends. His continued appearances on Bronies React, and new gig as multiple characters on the Fallout Equestria radio play by East Corp. Productions as well as in the animation “Allister and Melody by Luximus. He co-starred in a student film called “Under” with an on screen roll. And completed his first book narrations in the “Portals of Infinity” series with book 3 “Of Temples and Trials” and book 4 “The Sea of Grass” on both Audible and Ibooks. Stay Brony, my Friends.



Foal Papers, or Foaly to folks who know him, has been in the small personal horse fandom for over seven years, and still isn’t quite sure what to make of the whole thing, or why he keeps getting invited to conventions. That said, he’s incredibly grateful for all the remarkable opportunities it’s afforded him: chances to host panels with the Powers That Be of the pony world, to lend his support to charity auctions and fundraising campaigns, to participate in serious podcasts and silly live-streams… in short, to have repeatedly been in the privileged position to help people make good memories, while also creating some brilliant ones for himself. When he isn’t running around as Star Swirl the Bearded or putting the kettle on for yet another cup of tea, you can find him tweeting too much as @foalpapers. Be excellent to each other.


ILoveKimPossibleAlot (KP) is a YouTube critic, entertainer, and an analyst in the Brony community. Don't let the username fool you, she packs a punch with her content! KP is known for being a funny, lively personality that takes analyzing and talking about character troupes to a fun extreme. With over 125,000 subscribers, she is known for her humor, her wit, her movie referencing power and being the #1 Discord fangirl on the interwebs!

KP has always had a knack for reviewing and analyzing and a general interest in understanding why people are drawn to media. She’s especially drawn to animation shows, and you can see what led her on the path for loving the horse fandom. KP joined the fandom mid-season 3 officially, and unofficially since mid-season 2. What pushed her to get involved and to later make content is her fascination and interest in the character of Discord. Once she found herself passionate about analyzing him, the rest fell into place, and she started making content. Her channel produces a range of short analyzing spotlights, podcasts, reviews, and animations. 

She is also an interesting case, because unlike some, KP has a production team that helps her continually produce content. You can find more about that by checking out some of her panels!

He is most known for his gaming countdowns where rants, with mini-editorials about a various topic. He is the co-creator of TF2 Analysis Anarchy and CO of FOBEquestria, a military brony organization, and the host and dungeon master of three online D&D campaigns: Welcome to the Show, Tyranny of Dragons, and Curse of Strahd.Part reviewer, writer, comic artist, and all-around nut, Silver Quill’s role is as mixed as his hippogriff character. Actively participating in the fandom since 2012 through fan comics, Silver gained an audience that followed him to YouTube. His “After the Fact” series takes a comedic look at individual episodes and themes running throughout the series. He serves as an editorial and review contributor to Equestria Daily and recently revived the “Pinkie Pie Says Goodnight” comic series. Some might call him a horse’s patoot, but they’re just stating biological fact.


Greetings and Welcome everyone.  I am DRWolf.  I actually started a Youtube channel to work on my voice acting, but it's still a lot of fun finding what inspires me about MLP.  This show and the fandom surrounding it has become rather intriguing.  Quite unlike anything I've come across before.  Perhaps if you stay awhile, I can help you find some inspiration too.


Acelin Sleeves, or just simply Ace as he prefers to be called, is an up-and-coming practitioner of the prestigious arts. In other words, he is a magician hoping to make a name for himself alongside the greats such as David Clopperfield, Criss Angelbunny, David Mane, Harry Whodini, and Prance Burton. He has started practicing magic at a very young age and has since been perfecting it for when he gets his big break! Well, it just so happens that he found his break at Everfree Northwest where he will make his debut performance! Having already been performing professionally in his homeland of Califoalnia, and having also been an employee of Whinnyland for nearly three years, it is quite possible that his skills in sleight-of-hoof may astound you. So why not come down and see the pony of prestidigitation showcase some real magic?
