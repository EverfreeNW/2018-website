Hey artists! Ready for something fun? We’re happy to announce our 2018 Everfree Northwest Art Contest!

Be creative and make something really magical! Art must also be 8.5 inch x 11 inch size (letter size, any orientation) and at least 150 dpi resolution.

There will be one grand prize winner and 6 specially themed prize winners. The Grand Prize winner will receive a plush voucher, con store voucher, con t-shirt and a free, optional critique from the design staff!

The following awards will be given based on their individual criteria: 


- Rainbow Dash: The most jaw dropping artwork
- Applejack: The most true to the show artwork
- Rarity: The most elegant artwork
- Pinkie Pie: The most fun artwork
- Fluttershy: The sweetest/cutest artwork
