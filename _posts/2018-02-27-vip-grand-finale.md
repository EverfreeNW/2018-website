G.M. Berrow has written several episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic for Seasons 5, 7, and the upcoming season 8, including "The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows", "Daring Done?" and "Equestria Girls: Dance Magic". She has written over thirty shorts for the Equestria Girls web series, "Better Together", and has authored twenty-one official MLP:FiM chapter books (such as Lyra and Bon Bon and the Mares from S.M.I.L.E, Pinkie Pie Steps Up, Rainbow Dash Rights the Ship, and the Daring Do Adventure Collection). In addition to her work on MLP, Berrow has written for the new preschool series "Chomp Squad" and ghostwritten for several other popular Children's and YA book series. Before her life as a writer, Berrow worked in film and television production on shows such as "Law & Order: SVU" and "The Good Wife". She lives in Los Angeles, CA but you can find her on twitter at @gmberrow. Everyone knows her as "G.M." but you can totally call her "Gillian" if you want.

Josh Haber joined the writing staff of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic in season four, just as the show was transforming into a cultural phenomenon with an appeal that extended far beyond the traditional expectations of a girls’ show. Taking the reins in season six, Josh assumed story editing and show running responsibilities, guiding the program through it’s sixth, seventh, and eighth seasons, providing the springboard for the upcoming feature film, My Little Pony: the Movie. Mr. Haber provided similar services to the multi-million dollar video game franchise,
Skylanders, for the Activision Blizzard Studios’ animated series Skylanders Academy, shepherding that show through it’s first season on Netflix, before returning to My Little Pony as a writer-producer. Along with his work on My Little Pony and Skylanders, Josh has worked on some of animation’s most recognizable properties and brands at several studios including Marvel, Nickelodeon, Warner Brothers, and Disney.

Katrina Hadley has been working in the animation industry in Vancouver since 2005, primarily as a storyboard artist. In the past she’s worked on at least 14 different shows like: Edgar and Ellen, League of Super Evil and the Monster High“ DVD movies. She first joined the MLP team as a board artist for “Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks“, and was lucky enough to be asked to draw the illustrations for the end title credits. She’s also done storyboard work for MLP season 5, most notably the premier and 100th episodes. After storyboard supervising “Equestria Girls: Friendship Games“ she sassed her way into being assistant director for “Equestria Girls: Legend of Everfree“. She’s now co-director on the Equestria Girls TV specials. Katrina feels incredibly lucky to work on Equestria Girls since it feels like a combination of her 2 greatest loves growing up: My Little Pony and Sailor Moon!

Big Jim Miller is a storyboard artist, cartoonist, director and improvisor living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. He has worked primarily as a storyboard artist, most notably for 10 years at a.k.a. Cartoon Inc. on Cartoon Network’s ‘Ed, Edd n’ Eddy’, where he was a part of all 5 seasons, the 3 holiday specials and the tv movie. He has also done storyboard work on ‘Kid Vs. Kat’, Capcom’s ‘Dead Rising 3’ and the Hub’s ‘My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic”. After starting on MLP, he has since moved on to storyboard supervising seasons 2 and 3 of that series as well as the ‘Equestria Girls’ direct to DVD movie. Season 4 of MLP saw Jim promoted to co-director, director on Season 5, and Supervising Director on Season 6, which is currently being aired on the Discovery Family Network. Jim has also voiced the character Troubleshoes in the S5 episode, “Appleoosa’s Most Wanted.”

Pixelkitties is one of the biggest names in My Little Pony fanart!  She is perhaps best known for her work creating unique autograph images for the cast and crew of Friendship is Magic.  She also designs official pony shirts, playmats, game cards and merchandising art.  By day she runs a multimedia digital design team, creates merchandise for Star Wars, Marvel Comics and Disney, bravely walks barefoot across LEGO strewn floors, and by night she brews her own beer and fills the Twitterverse with poignant commentary.
