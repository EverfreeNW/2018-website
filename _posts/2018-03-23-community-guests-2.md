Everfree Northwest is quickly approaching and we’re bringing in a bunch of talented community guests. From those who work tirelessly to keep Equestria Daily running, to big names in the fanfiction and analysis communities. Check out these community guests below, and see what they have to offer in the thriving My Little Pony fandom.

Sethisto is the head pony at Equestria Daily. He’ll post his ponies and there’s nothing you can do about it!!!!!  He uses the exclamation point way too much, plays Skype/Discord/Steam social whack-a-mole for one half the day, and digs through emails for the other half. People seem to think he likes Trixie way too much! To them he says: “Pretty much.”
(Honestly Twilight Sparkle Sweet Velvet is his favorite pony~)
His OC apparently got locked in a cube or something, so have his bat.

CouchCrusader is the product of a stuffed animal's boundless imagination, loosed upon the world to make absurd jokes and make absurd jokes. Aside from providing convention coverage and episode followups on Equestria Daily, Couch also runs Children of Everfree, a Tumblr askblog that makes monsters of the Mane 6.

Around September 2012 Gameleon contacted Sethisto about a little app he was creating to view EQD posts. Over the following 6 months this little app would evolve to become what is now known as the Equestria Daily app, done just in time to be released for the Season 3 finale news.
Let's just say the app was properly stress tested during Gameleon's first few days on the team.
Aside from his app development duties, his contribution to EQD consist of posting minor news posts, and confusing us all with a 7-9 hour time difference and kilometers.

After joining the fandom in March of 2011—and watching Over a Barrel as his first brand new episode—The Illustrious Q was a fairly quiet member of the Brony fandom willing to just enjoy the show and let other more interested/energetic people make their mark in the fandom.
Then the IDW Comic series was announced in July in 2012, and that completely changed. Absorbing any and all pieces of information about the comic series—in addition to buying everything related to that series in sight—The Illustrious Q quickly became one of the fandoms experts on the My Little Pony Comic world. Once he had started interviewing and submitting interviews of the IDW staff to Equestria Daily, it wasn’t long before he was invited aboard as their Comic Expert.

"User" started getting into ponies around 2012 with the now defunct Pony Fortress 2 and Friendship is Gaming online communities and joined up with Equestria Daily in early 2017 as a community administrator who oversees the EQD forums, steam group, Discord (which you should join by the way!) He's considered by many to be a diehard Trixie loyalist and often mistaken for Sethisto himself whether in game or in other chat mediums due to his praise for best pony.  Other top tier mares of his include Starlight Glimmer, Sunset Shimmer, and Lightning Dust.


Hailing from the Toronto area in Canada he has a lifelong interest for traveling and that obviously translated over to attending conventions once he became a brony. He enjoys helping out with press work when needed for EQD. 

Author of the Wavelengths Timeline (and many others), Project Lead of Gardens of Equestria: This Coming Storm and designer of many a FimFic cover, Novel-Idea discovered MLP:FiM toward the end of Season 3 and thoroughly enjoyed it while everyone else was panicking about technicolor humans and magical wings.

After helping lead the charge to 50K in National Pony Writing Month in 2016, Novel returned in 2017 and orchestrated the greatest NaPoWriMo to date! After NaNo’s success (and only three straightjackets, a new personal record!), Novel stumbled upon the insane idea of helping out Equestria Daily with a deeper coverage of MLP fanfiction. He’s now enjoying his latest straightjacket. It’s purple.

When not in his straightjackets, Novel’s obsessively writing a minimum of 1,000 words a day on his lunch breaks, usually about Sunset Shimmer and/or Shipping and/or Deerponies. When not doing that, he spends time with his wife, Painted Heart and his two daughters, Primary Colour and Sunny Stage.

Oroboro got his start writing Haruhi Suzumiya Fanfiction in 2011, and found his way to the pony fandom in 2013 with a convoluted meta-murder-mystery he couldn't get out of his head. Now, he's found a comfortable niche writing EQG romance/drama fics such as Fractured Sunlight, and shipping Sunset Shimmer with every character that so much as makes eye contact.

If you want someone to blame for your addiction to Sunset Shimmer, he’s probably the root of it all. Someone was dumb enough to give this child a keyboard and a picture of Sunset, and it’s been all downhill ever since. A fanfiction writer since 2012, he’s spent five of the last six years writing long adventures and character analysis of one character. Someone should really take that keyboard from him.

Self-Proclaimed Leader of the Rarity Defense Squad, Monochromatic is widely regarded as the prime example of a ship choosing the author. Predominantly a romance writer, she is responsible for The Enchanted Library series and far too many RariTwi fics. She is also very much like Rarity. Except for the fashion sense. And the vocabulary. And the fabulosity. And the generosity. Actually, she's nothing like her, but isn't perfection a rarity, after all?

TD joined the fandom in early 2013, completing his binge-watch of the first three seasons just in time to get in arguments about how awesome Twilight becoming an alicorn was and how much Applejack and Rarity need to kiss. Since then, he has been drawn into the fanfiction community, and despite his initial resistance to writing fanfiction, has written over 40 stories, the most famous likely being two stories centered around the relationship between Twilight and Celestia, “The Stars Ascendant” and “Forever and Again and Again” as well as the popular comedies “Dying To Get There” and “The Collected Poems of Maud Pie”. As an active reviewer, he has reviewed over 1,000 stories, and looks forward to reading the next 1,873 stories on his read later list.
