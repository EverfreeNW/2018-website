## Sarah Edmondson Bio:

Sarah Edmondson is a talented actress with a radiant smile and natural charm. She has an exceptionally diverse portfolio of interests, and dedicates herself with limitless energy and positivity to the worlds of acting and yoga.
 
Born and raised in Vancouver B.C., Sarah first launched her professional acting career on the popular CBC teen soap series, "Edgemont", where she played the love interest to Grace Park’s (Hawaii Five-O) character, Shannon. From there, Sarah went on to numerous lead and supporting roles on SyFy’s "Andromeda", "Continuum", and "Stargate SG-1", USA Network’s "Dead Zone" and Lifetime Television’s "Killer Hair" and "Hostile Makeover". Sarah also guest-starred on J.J. Abram’s hit FOX series, "Fringe", and has been seen in a recurring role as a troublemaker ex-girlfriend on USA Network’s hugely successful dramedy, "Psych".
 
Sarah also didn’t hesitate to step into the role of a psychopathic criminal groupie in Blaine Thurier’s critically acclaimed feature, A GUN TO THE HEAD, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The launch of this film was on the heels of Sarah’s Leo Award-nominated comedic roles in the short films AWKWARD, which screened at The Just For Laughs International Comedy Festival, and SPARKLELITE MOTEL.
 
As a voice over artist, Sarah has created original voices for characters for Cartoon Network’s "Max Steel", and "Transformers Cybertron", Discovery Kids "Class of the Titans", Hasbro’s "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic", and Netflix’s "Dinotrux". Sarah has also voiced characters for numerous popular children’s series including The Rose in France Télévisions’ "Le Petit Prince", and Thea Stilton for "Geronimo Stilton". She can be heard as River in Season One of “Minecraft Mini Series: Challenge of the Spooky Isles” by Mattel Action!.

## Jason Deline Bio:

A veteran of stage, screen and radio, Jason has voiced thousands of commercials for clients such as Coke, Mitsubishi, Subaru & Movie Central. He has voiced lead characters in several hit cartoons such as Drago in 'Bakugan,' Benkei in 'Beyblade,' Glen in 'Beywheel,' and various characters in series such as 'Totally Spies!,' 'Arthur,' 'MagiNation,' and the upcoming film 'Spark,' and in Ponyville, makes an entrance as Bow HotHoof –Rainbow Dash’s Dad! He did a hilarious turn as the coked-out event organizer in the wrestling/monster comedy 'Monster Brawl' opposite Art Hindle and Dave Foley, and can be seen sporting a moustache as a newscaster in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.'
During his stints at various radio stations, Jason’s been an on-air host, writer, director, producer, and creative director.  Jason has also starred in, written and directed everything from TV series and commercials, to live theatre and sketch comedy.
Often consulted about casting and directing for various productions, Jason has developed a voiceover workshop for newcomers and seasoned veterans alike called Find Your Voice. It gives Jason a chance to instill good habits in voice performers, as well as meet some fantastic, unknown talent that he can keep in mind when casting and directing commercials, games and animated series.
