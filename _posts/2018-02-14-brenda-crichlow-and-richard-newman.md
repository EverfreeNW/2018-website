Actor/Director/Singer/Musician, Richard Newman was born and raised in what he wistfully remembers as "Chicagoland". After receiving his BA from Knox College, he continued his training at the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. From there, a season at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival led to his first "professional" gig: touring the wilds of British Columbia in a little red schoolbus, performing in schools under the aegis of Playhouse Holiday.

In the intervening years, his theatrical roles have ranged from Shylock and Otto Frank to Billy the Kid and The Son Of God himself, as well as an award-winning turn as Roy Cohn in "Angels in America". Recent appearances on screen include episodes of "Supernatural", "Witches of East End" and "Level Up". He has spent much of the last 25 years voicing such characters as Rhinox (Beast Wars), Mr. Turtle (Franklin), Capt. Ginyu (Dragon Ball Z) and Cranky Doodle Donkey (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) among many others.

When not acting, he can generally be found playing music with any number of talented, if wacky, friends.
